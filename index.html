    <p classname="anna"> January 21, 2019 ---Today was amazing beccause I went to the city with my friends. First, we stopped by the Brooklyn bridge to take some awesome photos together! After that, our hands were freezing from the bitter cold. It ok though, because we ate delicious seafood at Seamore's. Afer that we for ice cream for dessert. We got the toasted sesame and matcha ice cream from Taiyaki. Could always have seconds!! </p>

    <p classname="anna"> March 22, 2019 ---Today was a very busy day!! I went to school the whole day, but my mom was off from work. We got our broken garage door fixed and so now its brand new. I'm also going to see the school play, Fiddler on the Roof, to see my friend Brayden Chien with Sidney Wong! I'm super excited because the play teaser was so good. After the play tonight, I'm going to pick up LA aunt from the airport (JFK) because she's going to stay at my house for Jae-Jin's wedding tomorrow! </p>

    <p classname="anna"> March 23, 2019 ---Today was a spectacular day! Mommy was running around all day getting everyone prepared for the wedding tonight in the city! So excited to meet chef Damiel and ccelebrate Jae-Jin's special day with him. Other than preparing for the wedding, my day was super crazy because I went to my first debate tournament. My team was Amanda from North Middle School and Dana. I was also able to miss Excel, which was fun!! We rented a wheelcchair accessible van to make it easier to bring grandma into the city! </p>
